# QCore-C

QCore-C is a research language for **quantitative types**, **owned
resources**, **typed recoverable errors**, **checked cleanup**, and **checked
concurrency**, lowering to portable C11. Alongside the language, the project
builds a conservative, fail-closed checker for *existing* C source — the
"unrestricted-C gateway" — currently exercised against a pinned Fluent Bit
corpus.

- Language design: [`docs/QCORE_SPEC_r0_2.md`](docs/QCORE_SPEC_r0_2.md)
  (proposed revision 0.2). Its inherited sequential baseline is
  [`docs/qcore_quantitative_types_spec.md`](docs/qcore_quantitative_types_spec.md).
- Working with the repo as an AI agent? Start at [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) —
  the compressed status ledger, invariants, and per-change gate live there.

## What the type system tracks

QCore-C deliberately keeps separate quantitative domains separate instead of
overloading one number:

- **Usage grades** — how many times a value is demanded, as intervals.
- **Static indices and dimensions** — numeric type parameters with nominal
  units (`Bytes`, `Count<Fd>`, `Steps`, …); cross-unit arithmetic is rejected.
- **Quantitative credit** — linear, spendable capacity.
- **Live resource obligations** — what must be released, rolled back, or
  transferred; never weakened.
- **Cost summaries** — upper bounds, not tokens.
- **Effect rows and per-exit post-states** — what a function may do and what
  remains at each exit, including typed error exits.

Checked programs lower to C11 with a tagged-error ABI and cleanup-explicit
control flow, validated by translation certificates and native differential
execution.

## Project status

Development proceeds in bounded, individually accepted **cycles**; every
record is archived under [`docs/cycles/`](docs/cycles/).

**Complete (Cycles 1–17).** The sequential language end to end — dimension
and quantitative-axis declarations, interval-graded usage demand, ownership,
resource-flow bounds, path-sensitive typed errors, sealed error-region
cleanup, CFG lowering to the tagged-error C11 ABI, an executable small-step
model — plus the structural front end, the whole-program checker, the
multi-file driver, translation certificates, a restricted concurrency
checker (access authority, happens-before, mutex capabilities, lock order,
destruction custody), advanced control (cancellation, fallible LIFO cleanup,
double errors, linear capture), and a combined closure certificate.
[Cycle 17](docs/cycles/CYCLE_17.md) added principal product inference, the
fail-closed unrestricted-C11 gateway, explicit weak-memory candidate
executions, and a native threaded custody backend, with recorded MSVC and
AddressSanitizer runs.

**Bounded and recorded (Cycle 18).** A fail-closed
[Libevent event-reactor checker](docs/cycles/CYCLE_18.md): generation-safe
lifecycle and custody tracking, explicit callback authority, priority
schedule exploration, cross-context conflict checks, and source pinning,
with Lean theorems and
[multi-platform build evidence](docs/cycles/CYCLE_18_LIBEVENT_VALIDATION.md).
Sanitizer and deployed observation-hook evidence remain pending.

**In progress (Cycle 19).** The gateway applied to a
[pinned Fluent Bit corpus](docs/cycles/CYCLE_19.md) (CMetrics, CTraces,
librdkafka, ChunkIO, the input-chunk wrapper, Monkey): resource-function
contracts, library custody mechanisms (refcount/list/queue/arena),
a bounded chunk-lifecycle model, and Monkey/Libevent callback composition
with recorded native observations. **Verdicts stay honest**: raw translation
units are not promoted to `Safe` until per-path identity imports and real
observation evidence satisfy the cycle's fail-closed gates — see the
[library audit record](docs/cycles/CYCLE_19_FLUENT_BIT_LIBRARIES_VALIDATION.md)
and the archived [evidence reports](docs/reports/).

The [latest teardown observations](docs/reports/cycle19-native-teardown/README.md)
run the pinned native constructors and complete context → stream → chunk →
backend memory teardown under ASan, UBSan and leak checking. Five executions
bind 82 allocation generations and 13 chunks to reciprocal rings and exact
release order. The source chain also preserves unresolved OS custody through
parent release in 26 of 43 conditional mixed-backend cases. All 407 workspace
tests and the pinned audit pass; aggregate verdicts are unchanged. A further
[nine allocation failures and control](docs/reports/cycle19-constructor-failures/README.md)
account for 55 generations across rollback and teardown, preserving null-field
successes and zero error outputs on backend failure. General caller/failure
provenance, filesystem guarantees, aggregate custody, remaining wrapper lifecycle
and full event composition remain open. The
[unsupported backend close classification](docs/reports/cycle19-unsupported-close/README.md)
checks all other integer backend kinds symbolically: outer chunk release
preserves unresolved backend custody, so the result remains `Unknown`.
[Conditional parent teardown](docs/reports/cycle19-nested-unsupported/README.md)
retains those exact opaque identities through stream and context release.
[Four native unsupported-type constructor cases](docs/reports/cycle19-unsupported-constructors/README.md)
return null chunks and release all 24 allocation generations through rollback
and surviving-stream teardown. General caller reachability remains open.
[Twelve real Linux cleanup observations](docs/reports/cycle19-file-os/README.md)
now bind close, unmap and deletion to OS endpoint probes and inode witnesses in
exclusive temporary fixtures. A failed zero-length unmap retains its mapping.
These helper executions do not establish arbitrary filesystem teardown or
durability. [Six enclosing native filesystem runs](docs/reports/cycle19-file-tree/README.md)
add constructor, ring, release-order and OS endpoint evidence for one-file trees.
All 66 allocation generations are released. Injected unmap/close failures retain
live OS resources after parent release, and sync failure still allows cleanup.
[Eleven filesystem allocation failures and a control](docs/reports/cycle19-file-constructor-failures/README.md)
now account for 81 acquired generations and 73 recorded releases. Failed root
and chunk-name copies trigger two observed UBSan null-argument terminations;
eight generations remain outstanding in those interrupted prefixes. Ten returning
cases complete leak checking. These observations do not establish general caller
or failure guarantees, and no raw unit is promoted.
[Eight constructor OS-failure cases](docs/reports/cycle19-file-os-constructors/README.md)
add 88 fully released allocation generations. A suppressed rollback close retains
the original descriptor/inode after null chunk return and parent release; harness
reclamation is recorded separately. File-size fallback and POSIX allocation
return/errno conventions remain distinct, with general OS guarantees still open.
[Seven existing-file profiles](docs/reports/cycle19-file-existing/README.md)
release all 70 allocation generations. Valid and read-only content, malformed
magic, short headers and read-only empty files retain distinct outcomes and their
original inode/bytes. Suppressed chmod plus rollback-close failures preserve a
descriptor residual after parent release. General caller and lifecycle gates
remain open.
[Five native transition sequences](docs/reports/cycle19-file-transitions/README.md)
release all 50 generations and seven descriptor/mapping epochs. Logical rollback
leaves the mapped header length unchanged, so down/up reloads appended bytes.
Locked begin retries while direct write succeeds. These bounded observations
preserve the native behavior without claiming production reachability or general
transaction/lock guarantees.

[Three sync-failure sequences](docs/reports/cycle19-file-sync-failures/README.md)
release 30 more generations and four OS epochs. Failed commit preserves the
transaction and retry clears it. Down continues cleanup after failed sync;
commit while unmapped succeeds without syncing. These fixed injected observations
do not establish general OS failure behavior or durability.

[Four failed-down sequences](docs/reports/cycle19-file-unmap-failures/README.md)
release 40 more generations and seven OS epochs. Failed unmap retains the
original mapping, descriptor, up ring and counter; preceding successful sync
remains visible. Retry or parent teardown then releases that original epoch.
[Four descriptor-failure sequences](docs/reports/cycle19-file-descriptor-failures/README.md)
release 40 further generations and acquire five OS epochs. Failed close moves
the chunk down but retains its descriptor; down/up retries reject. A second
suppressed close leaves that descriptor live after parent release, with harness
reclamation recorded separately. Failed reopen creates no epoch; a successful
retry creates a fresh one. General reopen failures, production caller provenance,
aggregate custody and full event composition remain open.

**Active (Cycle 20).** Extraction of library-specific verification into a
[versioned verifier-plugin ecosystem](docs/cycles/CYCLE_20.md): a
length-delimited JSON protocol, manifests, a fail-closed registry, bounded
process providers, and a certificate firewall. Protocol v1 carries only
Boolean assertions, so the core currently refuses all v1 `Safe` proposals
and treats unchecked `Unsafe` proposals as `Unknown`; source-level
`verify scope` declarations are configuration-validated but not yet
dispatched.

**Trust and audits.** An independent
[reevaluation](docs/REEVALUATION_SPEC.md) (2026-09-05) reproduced six
certificate/weak-memory discrepancies, followed by a
[seven-finding follow-up](docs/REEVALUATION_FOLLOWUP.md); all thirteen are
repaired, with the remaining boundaries (interprocedural custody inference,
semantic plugin witnesses, OS-level provider sandboxing) documented rather
than papered over.

**Direction.** The [generalization plan](docs/GENERALIZATION_PLAN.md)
reviews the architecture and orders the work to (a) make the checker generic
over source sets — contracts and profiles as data, core-derived obligations,
interprocedural summary inference — and (b) decompose the monolithic crate
into a pluggable contract/verification system with a versioned schema
surface and out-of-process providers. W0 is executed
([record](docs/reports/w0-schema-crate/README.md)): the schema surface and
the CLI are standalone crates, with a test guarding the downward-only
dependency rule; providers stay compile-time crates for now (decision
recorded in the W0 report). The W1 relocation is executed
([record](docs/reports/w1-contract-crate/README.md)): the contract loader
and observation interpreter live in `crates/qcore-contract`, above the new
`qcore-core` kernel seed and `qcore-frontend` front-end crates. The W6 CT
conformance harness is stood up
([record](docs/reports/w6-ct-harness/README.md)): `compiler/tests/ct_corpus.rs`
executes the manifest-mapped spec §55 cases through the real source pipeline;
CT02/CT12/CT16 are mapped as sequential-core fixtures and 47 of 50 cases
remain unmapped, counted by a pinned test.

## Build and test

The Rust compiler and `qcorec check` / `qcorec emit` do not require Clang.
Compiling emitted C requires a C11 compiler (MSVC on Windows via the Rust
MSVC toolchain, a native compiler elsewhere). The full test suite also
exercises existing-C analysis, which needs Clang for preprocessing, syntax
validation, and its JSON AST; `cl.exe` cannot replace that dependency.

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
cargo test --workspace
cd proof
lake build
```

The Rust suite verifies that `third_party/libevent` is at the audited
revision and still contains the source constructs the Cycle 18 model relies
on; CI initializes the submodule before this gate. The Lean toolchain is
selected through `proof/lean-toolchain` (install a Lean 4 stable toolchain
via elan first).

### Windows

Install Rust's MSVC toolchain and Visual Studio or Build Tools with
**Desktop development with C++** (MSVC and the Windows SDK). Use an **x64
Native Tools Command Prompt** or **Developer PowerShell** when compiling
native C so the SDK, linker, and runtime DLLs are available. Generated-C
tests discover MSVC through the `cc` crate; no `cc` or `clang` command on
PATH is required.

For existing-C analysis and the full test suite, also install Visual
Studio's optional **C++ Clang tools for Windows** or a standalone LLVM
installation (see
[Microsoft's Clang setup instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/clang-support-msbuild)).
QCore locates the analysis compiler in this order:

1. `QCORE_CLANG`, when set, names a single executable (no extra arguments).
2. `clang` on PATH.
3. On Windows, LLVM under `VSINSTALLDIR` and Visual Studio installations
   found via `vswhere` (including Build Tools). Both `clang.exe` and
   `clang-cl.exe` work, using Clang's GCC driver mode for analysis.

An explicit path works without changing PATH, including paths with spaces:

```powershell
$env:QCORE_CLANG = 'C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin\clang.exe'
cargo test --workspace
```

An invalid or empty `QCORE_CLANG` is an error; it never silently selects
another compiler. If no Clang is found, existing-C analysis reports an
unavailable parser with installation guidance and does not issue a safety
certificate; ordinary QCore checking and C emission remain available:

```powershell
cargo build --bin qcorec
.\target\debug\qcorec.exe check examples\cycle12.qc
.\target\debug\qcorec.exe emit -o generated.c examples\cycle12.qc
```

Windows CI runs a core MSVC job (Clang discovery disabled; checking,
emission, native generated-C execution) and an MSVC-plus-Clang analysis job
(full suite including MSVC AddressSanitizer; Clang removed from PATH and
`VSINSTALLDIR` cleared to exercise `vswhere` discovery). Linux CI runs the
full suite.
