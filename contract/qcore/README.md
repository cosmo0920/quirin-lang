# QCore contract regression corpus

These native QCore sources are the durable, source-readable form of the
external-library contracts used by the compiler's Fluent Bit integration.
They are grouped by library and kept independent so each file can be checked
directly with `qcorec`.

The regression test in `compiler/tests/qcore_contract_corpus.rs` recursively
discovers every `.qcore` file, parses its function contracts into structured
clauses, and runs the complete compiler driver. It also pins the expected
contract-bearing declarations for each source, so deleting or accidentally
weakening a fixture is a test failure.

From the repository root:

```sh
cargo test -p qcore-compiler --test qcore_contract_corpus
cargo run -p qcore-compiler --bin qcorec -- check \
  contract/qcore/chunkio/import_composition.qcore
```

The clauses are retained in the source AST for future semantic passes. Today,
the driver checks their grammar and preserves their spans and expressions; it
does not yet use arbitrary contract predicates to mint a safety certificate.
