### Reopen failure evidence (2026-09-07)

Five native reopen size-lookup/mapping failure sequences release all 50
allocation generations and six mapping epochs. Ten descriptor epochs yield eight
library closes and two residuals after parent release, reclaimed separately by
the harness. Failed size lookup retains an unmapped descriptor; failed mapping
stores MAP_FAILED, reports up-ring membership without incrementing the counter,
and retains the new descriptor. Fixed retries and already-synced behavior remain
observations, not general OS failure or durability guarantees. Evidence:
`docs/reports/cycle19-reopen-failures/README.md`. Raw units remain unpromoted.

W2 bounded profile migration landed (2026-09-07;
`docs/reports/w2-profile-manifests/README.md`): schema v1 and total-or-reject
loading replace the library enum, source inventories, mechanism/operation
summary tables and Libevent API/build/source tables with declared profile data.
Full 185-TU diagnostic/source parity is byte-identical to baseline `43040e7`
(3 Safe / 98 provisional Unsafe / 80 Unknown / 4 data-only; the third Safe was
already W4's measured change). Raw production units stay unpromoted. Monkey
typed imports, Boolean field routing and first-party registration are migrated
in subsequent bounded increments below; configured orchestration remains W2/W5
work. This does not complete W2.

Frontend gates repaired (2026-09-07,
`docs/reports/w6-frontend-gates/README.md`): nonempty source function contracts
reject centrally with Q021 until enforced. Guard/thread-scope header names bind
only inside their bodies; at that checkpoint nested concurrency lowering rejected with Q500.
This closes the two W6 batch-2 frontend defects without claiming contract or
concurrency semantics were implemented by that increment. CT mapping was then 5/50;
the native source-task increment below advances it.

W2 H6 provider metadata discovery is implemented (2026-09-07;
`docs/reports/w2-provider-discovery/README.md`). First-party manifest literals
are removed after field-for-field parity; registry metadata is loaded atomically
from profile packages with stable plugin-id ordering and no compiled fallback.
All shipped providers remain v1 built-ins returning Unknown; process extraction
is still W5 work. Full 185-TU diagnostic/source parity is unchanged.

The [Lean CI hygiene](../../reports/w7-lean-ci/README.md) adds the pinned Lean
build and every theorem audit to CI, including a compiled QCore axiom check.
Both reevaluation probes also run in Linux and Clang-enabled Windows CI.
Local checks passed; the hosted workflow has not yet run.

[Generic Lean naming](../../reports/w7-generic-lean-names/README.md) makes the
descriptor-custody model, event composition and busy/lock preservation theorem
available under library-independent names while keeping historical aliases.

Boolean field profile routing landed (2026-09-07,
`docs/reports/w2-boolean-field-profiles/README.md`): typed C record/field and
Boolean operation routes come from loaded profile data, with exact declared
assumptions on summaries. An unrelated record fixture exercises both supported
models. Full 185-TU resource diagnostics and source projections are unchanged;
chunk reports add only three assumption maps. Frame-helper ABI generalization
and source-to-model identity premises remain open.

W5's bounded configured-audit extraction is implemented (2026-09-07;
`docs/reports/w5-configured-audit/README.md`). New L3 `qcore-audit` owns
compile-db ingestion, source selection, per-unit projection and reports over
W2 profiles/W1 contracts, depending only on gateway/contract/schemas. A separate
synthetic repository runs from data alone (1 Safe / 1 provisional Unsafe /
1 Unknown). Full 185-TU compatibility output is byte-identical; raw production
units stay unpromoted. The old example is a small wrapper; specialized native
and source evidence remains in `compiler/examples/support/cycle19_compatibility.rs`
until provider extraction/parity replaces it. This is not full W5 completion.

Monkey typed import profiles landed (2026-09-07,
`docs/reports/w2-monkey-typed-profile/README.md`): function roles, records,
sizeof bounds, exact callback signatures, callee bounds and callback effects
load from profile data. Malformed or unavailable declarations reject; wrappers
retain their existing opaque-call grammar. Full 185-TU diagnostics are unchanged;
18 syntax summaries now retain explicit declared profile assumptions. These are
syntax projections and trusted declarations, not proofs of source custody or
whole-program safety. General source/model binding and provider consolidation
remain open; configured auditing is recorded separately above.

Revision 0.3 implementation review (2026-09-07): resource/task lifetime checks,
unconditional axis validation, signed literal extrema and exact/maximum loop
custody are repaired at their stated model/source boundaries. Ordinary i32/unit
result compatibility is checked with an explicit separate custody payload;
full owned-result typing remains open. Concurrency certificates retain declared
mutex/synchronization premises; checked invariant/source authority remains open.
Observation replay rejects scope/module/bounds substitution. Current requirements
and bounded acceptance are in `docs/QCORE_SPEC_r0_3.md` and
`docs/reviews/r0_3/acceptance.json`; superseded specs live in `docs/obsolete/`.

W5 kernel and contract boundaries advanced (2026-09-07): sequential and
concurrent model modules now reside in dependency-free `qcore-core`, with
byte-identical implementations/tests and compiler reexports. Chunk lifecycle
also moved unchanged. Portable, untrusted chunk-path records live in schemas
0.2.0; `qcore-contract` evaluates declared paths, while only the opaque typed
source importer can issue source-checked compatibility certificates. No plugin
wire version or admission rule changed. See
`docs/reports/w5-sequential-kernel/README.md`,
`docs/reports/w5-concurrent-kernel/README.md`, and
`docs/reports/w5-chunk-summary-boundary/README.md`.
W4 now validates direct non-null `Removed` wrappers from contained entry to
live detached exit, with independent certificate rederivation and matching
Lean relations (`docs/reports/w4-removed-custody/README.md`). All 185 pinned
resource/source results remain unchanged; recursion, general removal aliases,
provider model extraction and broader source/CT coverage remain open.

W5 standalone packaging and frontend consolidation (2026-09-07): five
schema-only executable providers reproduce built-in v1 Unknown responses and
explicitly return v2 Unknown without witnesses. Package verification and two
clean reproducible builds pass; default registry selection is unchanged.
`providers/README.md` documents build/installation/rollback. Specialized
provider models and registry-based Fluent Bit composition remain open.
Whole-program checking now lives in frontend; generic loop/ledger checking
lives in core, with preserved compiler APIs and exact implementation/test body
parity. Evidence: `docs/reports/w5-provider-packages/README.md`,
`docs/reports/w5-whole-program-frontend/README.md`, and
`docs/reports/w5-resource-accounting/README.md`.

CLI package lifecycle (2026-09-07, `docs/reports/w5-cli-packages/README.md`):
`qcorec plugins verify PACKAGE`, `enable PACKAGE --config FILE`, and
`disable ID --config FILE` support explicit pinned process selections.
`check`/`emit --plugins FILE` and list/inspect with `--config FILE` consume
that selection without default fallback. Verification reads manifest and
executable identity without executing it; this is a snapshot check, not
signature, runtime compatibility or immutable-execution proof.

Trusted verification adapter (2026-09-07): obligation derivation, witness replay
and scope dispatch now live in `crates/qcore-verification`, with byte-identical
implementations/tests and compiler reexports. It depends on core, frontend,
contract, schemas and host; providers cannot link it. Lifecycle source effects
remain incomplete and cannot promote a result. Evidence:
`docs/reports/w5-verification-adapter/README.md`.

W4 output forwarding and identity invalidation (2026-09-07): direct output
pointer forwarding now validates original sanctioned slots on every exit.
Formal shadowing, pointer mutation and direct alias chains cannot reuse stale
resource identity. Evidence: `docs/reports/w4-out-forwarding/README.md`.
That increment measured 3 Safe / 94 provisional Unsafe / 84 Unknown /
4 data-only, with no promotions. The subsequent indirect-access repair
(`docs/reports/w4-indirect-access/README.md`) rejects unmodeled dereference,
member and indexed access instead of erasing it from the resource projection.
The current 185-unit audit is 2 Safe / 42 provisional Unsafe / 137 Unknown /
4 data-only: 48 units and 455 functions downgrade, with no promotions.
These are withdrawn unsupported results, not proven upstream defects.
Typed access evidence, general pointer aliases and recursion remain open.

The generic reactor lifecycle and descriptor model now resides in
`crates/qcore-core/src/event_reactor.rs`, parameterized by an explicit accepted
profile list. The Libevent adapter retains build matching and pinned source
checks, and preserves concrete enum imports through a lossless facade.
Evidence: `docs/reports/w5-generic-reactor/README.md`. Callback source binding/protocol admission, specialized provider extraction
and registry-based corpus composition remain open.

Generic callback records (2026-09-07): `qcore-schemas::reactor` and
`qcore-verification::reactor_callback` support strict declared-model record
exchange against the complete assignment inventory. A schemas-only process
fixture exercises matching and adversarial proposals. This adds no protocol
witness admission or source-derived authority; Monkey effect records retain
their separate interpretation. Evidence:
`docs/reports/w5-reactor-callback-records/README.md`. Source binding,
specialized provider extraction and registry composition remain open.

Source-derived field-contract provider path (2026-09-07): the typed Boolean
importer now lives in `qcore-c-gateway`, with opaque source/build/profile/helper
identity snapshots and compiler compatibility APIs. `qcore-verification` derives
function-scoped evidence-v2 tasks and replays exact source paths plus pinned
contracts. The real ChunkIO 0.2.0 package proposes witnesses; the audit selects
it explicitly with `QCORE_CHUNKIO_PACKAGE`. Three real functions check across
four Boolean-state combinations each; 93 other selected functions remain
Unknown. Source, resource diagnostics and existing contract sidecars retain
byte parity. Raw unit totals remain 2 Safe / 42 provisional Unsafe / 137 Unknown /
4 data-only. Evidence: `docs/reports/w3-source-field-provider/README.md`.
Full lifecycle source inference, provider-owned source analysis and aggregate
registry composition remain open; this bounded property does not discharge them.

ChunkIO statement execution (2026-09-07): package 0.3.0 independently computes
Boolean-field paths from a version-2 typed statement program. Requests no longer
carry expected paths. The receiver retains opaque source identity, compares
complete proposed paths and evaluates the pinned contract. Parser/evaluator
semantics retain parity; source import and helper ABI checks stay trusted.
Evidence: `docs/reports/w5-provider-statement-execution/README.md`. Full lifecycle
import, other specialized provider analysis and registry composition remain open.

Contextual recursion (2026-09-07): W4 now infers validated custody for one
immutable explicit integer control, partitioned into zero/nonzero cases. Base
contexts have no SCC-call contracts; nonzero contexts call already validated
zero contexts via exact zero literals. Both contracts must agree, and the
combined CFG is revalidated and independently rederived by certificate checking.
Release, owned-return and bounded mutual-recursion source cases pass; mutations,
nondecreasing calls, zero cycles and broader controls remain outside this route.
Evidence: `docs/reports/w4-contextual-recursion/README.md`. General recursive
fixed points, broader arithmetic rankings, aliases and cost summaries remain open;
the unsigned countdown extension below covers exact `n - 1` calls.

Source task foundations (2026-09-07): structured spawn/join records now retain
ordered captures, resolved scope/worker/place symbols and initializer-before-binder
identity. The core scoped-task ledger checks reservation rollback, completion
capsules, creator-only join and scope exits; matching Lean transfer theorems and
adversarial scenarios pass. These components are not yet composed into source
execution at that checkpoint: task scopes still rejected and CT coverage was
5/50. The native source-task increment below now composes the copy-only path. Evidence:
`docs/reports/w6-source-task-foundations/README.md`.

Schema compatibility (2026-09-07): `qcore-schemas` is now 1.0.0 and all Rust
consumers require that major version. The version-2 typed program input replaced
a public summary field, requiring the documented breaking-change policy.
Protocol v1, evidence v2, program schema/profile v2 and ChunkIO package 0.3.0
retain their separate versions. Evidence:
`docs/reports/schema-1-compatibility/README.md`.

Native source tasks (2026-09-07): `compile_files` and normal `qcorec check`/`emit`
now execute the scoped-copy profile on Linux C11 threads. A typed finite task
IR checks all definitions, creation outcomes, declared worker outcomes, exact
scalar/handle/result identities and permitted effects. Native start records
survive until creator join; unexpected join failure aborts before reclamation.
`CompiledModule.checked` explicitly separates sequential and task evidence.
CT15 now maps actual native join failure with a successful join/free control;
CT19 uses a real second-spawn failure rejection and joined-sibling control.
Explicit Result handlers now recover from failed creation while preserving and
joining prior siblings; join handlers preserve exact worker errors. CT13 maps
real Linux success, first/second-create failure and join-before-free controls.
Coverage at that checkpoint was 7/50 mapped, 43 unmapped. Moves/loans, owned results, shared memory,
mutexes, nested workers, general control flow and other platforms remain open.
Evidence: `docs/reports/w6-task-recovery/README.md`.

macOS native concurrency (2026-09-08): scoped copy/owned/read-loan/read-share
tasks, typed owned-error payload tasks and checked mutex guards now check, emit,
compile and execute on macOS through an emitted pthread-backed implementation
of the C11 thread subset used by QCore. The macOS CT harness executes the
threaded native and fault-injection cases; CT50's separate
`MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE` address-reuse observation remains Linux-only. Apple
ASan/UBSan runs remain enabled, while leak detection stays a Linux-only
observation because Apple's AddressSanitizer does not provide LSan. Configured
audit compile inputs compare canonical existing paths so the macOS `/var` to
`/private/var` alias cannot spuriously invalidate a pinned task, and archived
Linux trace replay pins Linux errno values instead of reading the host Python
errno table.

Nullable removal and custody transfer validation (2026-09-07): W4 now validates
nullable `Removed` preconditions, including null-guarded nonnull removal and
reordered direct forwarding. Null refinement removes only the absent child's
containment edges; original owners and other children remain accounted for.
Confirmed false-Safe cases in merged removal, alias-selected actions, aggregate
cleanup and terminal custody reuse are repaired. Ambiguous effects retain
unresolved custody; independent leak evidence remains visible. General aliases,
heap-link discovery and relational branch analysis remain open. Evidence:
`docs/reports/w4-nullable-removal/README.md`.
The fresh 185-unit audit records 2 Safe /42 provisional Unsafe /137 Unknown
plus four data-only units. Five previous provisional Unsafe units now remain
Unknown because their residual leaks depended on unresolved effects. Source,
chunk-contract and source-effect reports are byte-identical; 22 units have
diagnostic changes. No raw unit is promoted.

Configured source-contract dispatch is implemented (2026-09-07;
`docs/reports/w5-configured-source-contracts/README.md`). The L3 audit service
loads explicit package/library/policy bindings, snapshots policy bytes and
selects providers from sealed Clang import identities. `QCORE_SOURCE_CONTRACTS`
selects the configuration; `QCORE_CHUNKIO_PACKAGE` remains a compatible package
path alias, and selecting both rejects. The selected process supplies typed
Boolean-field witnesses for independent trusted replay. A second C codebase
passes through the same service and a schemas-only process fixture under its
declared existing Boolean-axis profile. All four full 185-unit audit artifacts
are byte-identical to the preceding baseline and between both selectors:
2 Safe / 42 provisional Unsafe / 137 Unknown, plus four data-only units;
three checked function contracts and 93 Unknown entries remain unpromoted.
Hardcoded provider/policy selection and the duplicate pre-dispatch evaluation
are removed from this bounded process route. General lifecycle source import,
other specialized adapters and full W5 consolidation remain open.

Configured Boolean frame helpers are implemented (2026-09-07;
`docs/reports/w5-configured-frame-helpers/README.md`). Helper source/function/
record/policy selection now comes from configuration. The gateway validates
exact declared record/prototype/field vectors, source/build/profile identity
and constant-only metadata writes disjoint from every modeled field on the
record. A second codebase executes a separately imported helper through the
same schemas-only process and trusted replay. The reusable service rejects
unrepresented compiler options; the pinned adapter explicitly retains its
historical option projection. Actual nested C layout/linker equality remains
an outer-audit premise. Ten generic Lean frame-preservation theorems pass.
No raw Cycle19 unit is promoted: 2 Safe /42 provisional Unsafe /137 Unknown
plus four data-only units; three checked function contracts and 93 Unknown.
The helper policy inventory is explicit report metadata; general lifecycle
import and broader W5 consolidation remain open. Owned task execution advances
in the subsequent bounded W6 increment below.

W7 diagnostic attribution now requires the exact selected plugin ID plus one
1–128-byte ASCII local code (letters, digits, underscore or hyphen), in both
protocol response checks. Nested-provider spoofing, empty suffixes and control
characters reject with QP007 before verdict admission. Valid provider codes and
all existing evidence gates remain unchanged. This repairs attribution, not a
previously demonstrated Safe-admission bypass. Evidence:
`docs/reports/w7-diagnostic-attribution/README.md`.
